  { name: 'Pearl Millet/Mahangu',
    scientificName: 'Pennisetum glaucum',
    shortDescription: 'Pearl millet is the major food cereal in the northern communinal areas and is popularly known as mahangu. Pearl millet is normally reserved for those areas where maize and sorghum fail to grow because of low rainfall or adverse soil factors. ',
    image: 'C:/Users/Fredrika/Desktop/Vue/climate-app/src/assets/image/crops/mahangu.jpg',
    sowingTime: 'October / November (after three consecutive rainy days with an accumulated rainfall of atleast 20 mm.)',
    annualRainfall: '300 - 700 mm',
    harvest: 'Mature, dry heads are cut and placed on an elevated platform to dry further for threshing.',
    sowingDepth: '30 - 40 mm',
    soilPH: 'Neutral',
    soilPreferences: 'Tolerates a wide range of soils but performs best on well drained deep and lightly textured soils. Tolerates soils with less than 10% clay but does not tolerate waterlogging. High tolerance to salinity. '

  { name: 'Sorghum',
    scientificName: 'Sorghum bicolor',
    shortDescription: 'Sorghum is a traditional staple food throughout the semi-arid areas of Africa. It is  a crop of multiple uses.',

    sowingTime: 'October / November',
    annualRainfall: '300 - 400 mm ( highly drought resistant )',
    harvest: 'Harvest at complete ripeness; thresh by beating with stick / thresher.',
    sowingDepth: '2 - 3 cm in clay soils; 5 - 6 cm in sandy soils',
    soilPH: 'Neutral',
    soilPreferences: 'None. Produces best in fertile, well-drained, well-structured soils of medium texture.  Very high tolerance to salinity.'

  { name: 'Maize',
    scientificName: 'Zea mays',
    shortDescription: 'It is an annual summer crop with a large number of cultivators including corn, popcorn etc. Maize is cross-pollinated. The kernel is a fruit with one seed and in mature stage consist of three main parts: the teets, the starchy endosperm and the embryo.',
    image: 'C:/Users/Fredrika/Desktop/Vue/climate-app/src/assets/image/crops/maize.jpg',
    sowingTime: 'Mid-December to mid-February',
    annualRainfall: '500-900ml',
    harvest: 'Harvest as soon as maize is dry to avoid damage by rodents,termites, weevils and grain moths in the field',
    sowingDepth: '7.5cm in sandy soils, 5cm in clay soils',
    soilPH: 'Tolerates 5-8; optimum is 6-7',
    soilPreferences: 'Tolerates wide range of soils but best on well-drained, well-aerated, deep(60cm) loans and silt loams'

  { name: 'Cowpeas',
    scientificName: 'Vigna unguiculata',
    shortDescription: 'Cowpeas are able to fix nitrogen in their roots with the help of bacteria, therefore increasing soil fertility. It is an ideal crop for Namibia as toerates heat and relatively dry weather conditions',
    image: 'C:/Users/Fredrika/Desktop/Vue/climate-app/src/assets/image/crops/cowpease.jpg',
    sowingTime: 'Since cowpeas are cold-sensitive they should be planted early in the season, as soon as the first rains are expected',
    annualRainfall: '500ml per year',
    harvest: 'for human consumptions, pods can be picked when they ripen i.e when the colour starts to change from green to purplish or cream',
    sowingDepth: '5-10cm in sandy soil, 3-7cm in heavy soils',
    soilPH: 'Does not tolerate alkaline(pH >=8) or acid(ph <=4.5) soils',
    soilPreferences: 'Sandy topsoil with 5-10% clay and sandy loam and underneath with 10-20% clay contents. Needs 1.2 m deep soils'
